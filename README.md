# McDonalds_Data_Analysis
Data analysis performed on the McDonalds menu dataset from Kaggle.

Analysis performed using Pandas, Matplotlib and Searborn.

## Goals of Analysis
Analysis aimed to answer the following questions:
1. How many calories does the average McDonald's value meal contain? 
2. How much do beverages, like soda or coffee, contribute to the overall caloric intake? 
3. Does ordered grilled chicken instead of crispy increase a sandwich's nutritional value? 
4. What about ordering egg whites instead of whole eggs? 

## Data Visualization
Data visualization was performed using Seaborn to look at the data in a different way.
